Python Programming Concepts Repository
This repository contains Python programs organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific concept. The goal is to enhance your computational thinking and coding skills. Below are the details of each section and the corresponding files:

File 1: Sequential Statements
Objective: Apply computational thinking to devise solutions for given problems.
Skills Covered: Identifying the type of statements required (sequential, alternative, and iterative) to solve problems.
                Coding simple Python programs to prompt user input, use variables, and evaluate expressions.
                
File 2: Alternate Statements
Objective: Apply computational thinking to devise solutions for given problems.
Skills Covered: Coding Python programs using conditional statements to solve problems.

File 3: Iterative Statements
Objective: Apply computational thinking to devise solutions for given problems.
Skills Covered: Coding Python programs using appropriate looping constructs to solve problems.

File 4: User Defined Functions
Objective: Apply computational thinking to devise solutions through modular programming.
Skills Covered: Coding Python programs by defining functions with appropriate parameters and return statements.

File 5: Strings (without built-in functions)
Objective: Apply computational thinking to devise solutions using strings.
Skills Covered: Coding Python programs by defining functions to handle strings.

File 6: Recursion
Objective: Solve problems that can be addressed by processing smaller instances of the same problem.
Skills Covered: Writing Python code that recursively invokes methods to solve problems.

File 7: Lists
Objective: Apply computational thinking to devise solutions using lists.
